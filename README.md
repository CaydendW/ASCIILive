# ASCIILive
A Python project that takes input from your webcam and converts it to ASCII in real-time and puts the output into command line creating an animated ASCII picture.

This file has 3 dependencies: Numpy, CV2(A.K.A:OpenCV) and PIL(A.K.A:Pillow, Python Imaging Library)

This file WILL NOT work on any linux distribution. The reason for is because of the following: os.system('cls'). If a Linux friendly alternative can be found just replace it with that.

If You do use my code please give me credit.

You will need to change the location of where an image is stored. (Mine was in D:\Users\cayde\Documents\Code\Resources\Python.jpg) Just replace that with your own directory of your choice and the code will do the rest.
